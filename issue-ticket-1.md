# PROJECT ISSUE TICKET

## Unexpected Behavior

> I am having trouble setting up my backend. It's not that I can't get things to work (i.e. CRUD), it's mainly that I don't know the best way to setup the Users>Posts>Comments model and also how this would translate to the frontend. Becuase I can have a triple nested resource routes but I don't think that's entirely necessary.

## Expected Behavior

> Efficient backend arhitecture that is setup to accomodate additional features such as friends and sub comments.

## Reproduce the Error

> It's not really an error.


## Documentation

> It's not really an error.


## Attempted Resolution

> I'm seeing but not connecting the dots.
